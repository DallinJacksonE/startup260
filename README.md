Deliverable and notes for CS260 at BYU
## Pitch
My sister has built up a small business over the last few years, and I'd like to make her a website where she can show her products, upcoming fairs, and for paying users, sell video tutorials for her work.
There is a lot to set up and learn, but I am hopeful that I can make her something that she can use to generate more income and online presence.

## Key Features
This website will be primarily a communication tool for my sister. It will include the ability for customers to log, see a splash screen and feed with current information that Kaylie will be able to edit and change. There will be a gallery of available products for purchase. A login will be required to enter the chat, where one can place orders and give specifications about how they want their products. In the chat, users will talk with Kaylie, and once an agreement is made, they will pay Kaylie's venmo account. The website will then made a ticket that Kaylie will be able to see on an orders page only available to users with the admin status. She can mark them complete, then send the user a message that their product is on the way. 

## Technologies
1. **Authentication** will be used by customers that wish to purchase an item. It will be used so that users can have private chats with Kaylie, exchange a shipping address, and pay. 
2. **Database data** will store users and their information, a list of Kaylie's inventory, her active status, and orders that she has accepted and their completion status.
3. **WebSocket data** will be used for chats, orders created by the user, and users who want to be emailed when Kaylie's status is active again.
4. **HTML, CSS** will be used to build the website and style it. Kaylie currently wants to be a UI/UX designer, so it will be fun to do that together.
5. **Javavscript** will power the order buttons for the users, it will fill out an order ticket for them that they can review and send to Kaylie.
6. **Web Service** include providing a link and mini gallery to Kaylie's Creations Instagram account
7. **Web Framework** will be rewritten with React to add more components and functionality.
