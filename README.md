Deliverable and notes for CS260 at BYU

My sister has built up a small business over the last few years, and I'd like to make her a website where she can show her products, upcoming fairs, and for paying users, sell video tutorials for her work.
There is a lot to set up and learn, but I am hopeful that I can make her something that she can use to generate more income and online presence.
